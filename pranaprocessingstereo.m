function pranaprocessingstereo(Data,I1,I2,maskname)
% this is a dummy file.  It should be deleted.  pranaprocessingstereo was
% identical to pranaprocessing, except for the use of 2 input directories.
% Now pranaprocessing understands 2 directories, so there is no use for
% this function.  Hunt down all calls to pranaprocessingstereo and replace
% them with pranaprocessing().
